1.
enter kakfa home dir 
./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties (space before config)
-to start zookeeper

2.
open new terminal
enter kafka home dir
./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties (space before config)
-to start kafka server or broker

3.
open new terminal and enter jps command should display kafka

4.Creating topic
enter kafka home dir
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic <topic name> --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
(for localhost value check for listeners in terminal where server is running)

--Currently- 3 terminals open

5. To check all topics created in kafka broker
enter kafka home dir
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

6.Describing topic- definition or syntax given while creating topic
enter kafka home dir
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic <topic name>
(displays partition, leader, replicas, Isr)
Isr- in sync replicas

--Currently kafka running, zookeeper runnning, topic created

7.To make current system producer
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic <topic name> 
(provide bootstrap server and topic name)
You will get a prompt to enter message

Open new terminal. We have producer so we're creating consumer
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic <topic name>
(provide bootstrap server and topic name)

Now if you enter messages in prompt in prev terminal, you can see it in the new terminal.
But only messages entered after creating consumer are visible to change this add --from-beginning ie:
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic <topic name> --from-beginning
All messages sent from beginning can be seen

--Currently- 4 terminals

Above commmands are for console producer and console consumer

8.To close producer or consumer: Ctrl+c

9.Single broker, multi broker system
multi broker- multiple brokers running in same system or multiple systems
multiple servers running parallely and has replicas
Run same server in diff ports ie:9092, 9093.....

In third terminal where we created producer, we are making some modifications to make it multi broker
Copying 

cp config/server.properties config/server-1.properties

To edit, open using gedit or nano or vi. 
vi config/server-1.properties
nano config/server-1.properties

Change broker.id=1 (change broker id as required here 1 cause second broker), 
port value in listeners (uncomment and change here, changed to 9093), log.dir=.....logs to log.dir=...logs-1 (here -1 as sencond file).

Similarly create as many brokers as required

./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-1.properties (starting server 1)

Create new terminal and run server 2.....

server 1 running in 9093, 2 in 9094... (these port changes were made in properties file)

10. Creating a topic with replication and partitions
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic <topic name> --bootstrap-server localhost:9092, localhost:9093, localhost: 9094 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 2
(rep factor should be lesser than equal to no. of brokers, multi broker add ports in local host as in above command)
(In above command, three brokers)

11. Terminating or shutting down broker- Ctrl+c

If a server is terminates (Ctrl+c), it is not in sync anymore so not available in Isr anymore.
When the server is restarted, after sometime it can be seen in Isr.

12. Use third party library for kafka clients
In kafka documents, APIs- Producer API you'll get a dependency
(Just like Gson dependency added to pom.xml)

13. key.serialiser, value.serializer- producer value data type 
-add producer dependencies from kafka documentation API
-assign topic name (make sure topic already exists)
-props.put(- add brokers for multiple brokers
-open console consumer as done before
-start program, message written there can be seen in the consumer started in terminal
-create method called senddatatokafka (*extract method)
